## 👨‍💻 About the Developer

Hi! I'm **Yash Akarsh**, a Computer Science student from India.

I started building ZERA back in **2021** while I was in **Grade 9**, during my early learning phase in programming. I’m aware that the code may not be optimized and might contain unused or buggy components — this was part of my learning journey.

The last major update was in **2022**, where I focused on redesigning the UI to make it look more futuristic.

Feel free to explore, improve, and contribute to the project!  
Thanks for checking it out! 🚀
