    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Yash Akarsh</strong>, a Computer Science student from India. I began developing ZERA in 2021 while I was in Grade 9. At that time, I was still learning programming, so the code may not be fully optimized and could contain unused or buggy components.</p>
    <p>The last major update was made in 2022, primarily focused on improving the UI to give it a more futuristic look.</p>
    <p>This project is open to improvements. Feel free to explore the code and contribute any enhancements!</p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
