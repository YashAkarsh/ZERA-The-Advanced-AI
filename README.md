<h2>About the developer</h2>
<br>
Hey there I am Yash Akarsh.
I built this software while I was in my grade 9 (2021). I am aware that the code written is not at all optimized and may contain alot of bugs and random stuff that is not even being used, but I made this thing while I was in my learning stage of coding and the last update that I did was in 2022 where I changed the UI to make it look like more futuristic.
Nothing much to tell I am just a CS student living in India.
Feel free to make any changes to the code that you think is required.
Thanks!
